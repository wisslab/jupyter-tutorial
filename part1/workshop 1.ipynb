    "\n",
    "Jupyter is constanty developed and currently, there are two interfaces that can be used: Jupyter Lab and the classic Jupyter Notebook. As Jupyter Lab recently reached version 1.0 and will replace the classic interface in the future, we will use it during our tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have as much time as possibe for the interesting parts of the tutorial, i.e., how to use Jupyter Lab, please make sure that you have it already preinstalled on your machine, as described in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation before the tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend to install Anaconda, which contains Jupyter Lab. To ensure that we are all on the same version, please update Jupyter Lab to the most recent version, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Install Anaconda distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section), Python 3.7 version for your OS\n",
    "- Step 2a: Open Anaconda Prompt from Start Menu <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"anaconda menu.png\" width=\"200\"><br/>\n",
    "- Step 2b: Type ```conda update jupyterlab```\n",
    "- Step 3 (Optional): Install a LaTeX environment for your OS (Linux: TeX Live, macOS (OS X): MacTeX, Windows: MikTex)\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of the LaTeX environment is only needed to export Jupyter Notebooks as PDF. We will demonstrate this during the tutorial, but it is not necessary for the tutorial, that you can do this on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be sure that you are ready for our tutorial, please create a new directory that will use as working directory for this tutorial. Open Anaconda Prompt, navigate to this directory, and run the command ```jupyter lab```. Now your browser should open automatically, with Jupyter Lab running in your tutorial directory. Congratulations, you are ready!\n"
