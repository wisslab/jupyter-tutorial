Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application for creating and sharing “live documents” that can contain code and the results from its execution besides traditional document elements like text or images. Originally being developed as part of the IPython project, it is now independent of Python and supports a long list of different programming languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, R and Perl.

These live documents are uniquely suited to create teaching materials and interactive manuals that allow the reader to make changes to program code and see the results within the same environment: program outputs can be displayed, visualisation graphics or data tables can be updated on-the-fly. To support traditional use cases, static non-interactive versions can be exported in PDF, HTML or LaTeX format.

For data practitioners, Jupyter Notebooks are ideal to perform data analyses or transformations, e.g., to generate Linked Open Data, where the workflow documentation is part of the implementation. Single lines of code can be added or changed and then executed without losing the results of prior parts of the code. Visualizations can be generated in code and are directly embedded in the document. This makes prototyping and experimenting highly efficient and actually a lot of fun. Finally, Jupyter Notebooks are an ideal platform for beginners, as they can execute code line by line and immediately see how changes affect the result.
This workshop requires no prior knowledge of Jupyter Notebooks or the Python programming language; only basic programming and HTML/Markdown knowledge is required. Please bring your own laptop.
Agenda:

- Part I: Introduction (Local installation of the necessary programming environment ++ Using existing documents ++ Creating documents with rich content ++ Notebook extensions)
- Part II: Case studies (Using Jupyter Notebook in teaching data integration basics ++ Using Jupyter Notebook to develop, test and document a data management workflow with generation of RDF)
- Part III: Advanced topics (Server installation and use ++ Version control ++ Using different language kernels)
